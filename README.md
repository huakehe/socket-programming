I think our program is fully functional.

First cd into the directory.

and then enter make, and it will compile:
server_c_udp 
client_c_udp 
server_c_tcp 
client_c_tcp

And you can run with ./(one server) PortNumber
Then in another terminal run ./(one client) IPAddress PortNumber  

It will show enter string, and a string should be entered.
Depending on the string you entered, the result will be shown in the client terminal.
